    <h1>-- About Us --</h1>


<p id="aboutstyle">Hello, my name is Maria C. and I recetntly started to take an interest in the coding language. I live in the East Coast of the USA and is the oldest sibling. I am attending a STEM highschool for engineering. My favorite season is winter and autumn follows, but tea and starwberry milkshakes are my favorite beverages.
<br></br>  
I created this website to encourage and support girls who want to be an engineer of enter a STEM field. Further, I made this website to introduce girls or anyone who comes a across this website about STEM. 
<br></br>
I grew up with a family in the STEM field, but I learned not every girl knows what STEM is or if they can do it; at least this website will infromations girls of this field so they are aware they can do a STEM field. 
<br></br>  
I am proud with what I have come up so far for this website, and coding in general, and is excitied to add more to it as there are some bugs to fix. 
<br></br>  
Thank you!
</p>
