    <h1 id="TE">-- Engineering Fields --</h1>

<h3 id="TE3">Engineering is a discipline, but there are many types of engineers. Down below you will find the main branches of engineering. But there are hundreds more of sub fields!
<br></br>
Fact: Many engineers who study in one field can still work in other engineering fields, study a new field, and work in industries such as the fashion and music industries!
